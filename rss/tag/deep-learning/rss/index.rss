The proposed architecture has narrow layers, which provide state-of-the-art results for as low as 12 channel feature maps. Fewer and narrower layers means that the model has <strong>fewer parameters</strong> to learn, making them easier to train.

Research papers (in the context of Deep Learning) can be difficult to understand because they are more about what drives the design decisions of a neural network. Inspecting the code (usually the network/model code) can reduce this complexity because sometimes itâ€™s just the implementation that we are interested in. Some people prefer first seeing the implementation and then trying to figure out the reasoning behind the design decisions of the network. Regardless, reading the code, before or after, always helps.</p><p>The code of the DenseNet implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet" rel="noopener">here</a>.

This helps in feature-reuse, better gradient flow, reduced parameter count and better transmission of features across the network. Such an implementation can help in training deeper networks using less computational resources and with better results.<br></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
