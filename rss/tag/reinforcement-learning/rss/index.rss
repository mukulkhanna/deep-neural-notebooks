We talk about his journey - how he started with Machine Learning &amp; RL. I ask him about his thoughts on the state of RL - about how the field has progressed and changed since he started, about how it has become so popular in the last few years, and about the challenges being faced.</p><p>We also talk about his research at Waymo, about recent projects from his lab, and about the scope and future of telepresence robots, one of which was developed under his guidance. We also talk about the infamous Reward Hypothesis in the context of RL and Philosophy. In the end, he also shares some advice for people starting out with RL.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bbrYZDgPI9M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Links: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbrYZDgPI9M">Youtube</a> / <a href="https://anchor.fm/deep-neural-notebooks/episodes/DNN-7-Reinforcement-Learning--Research-at-Waymo--University-of-Oxford--Shimon-Whiteson-eem6ef">Anchor.fm</a> / <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/deep-neural-notebooks/id1488705711?i=1000476058716">Apple Podcasts</a> / <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3936aEvSwsIhfwQfURmDb9">Spotify</a></p>
