Her research interests are in computer vision and machine learning for human-computer interaction and smart interfaces.</p><p>At NVIDIA, she has developed technologies for gaze estimation, 2D and 3D head pose estimation, hand gesture recognition, face detection, video stabilization and GPU-optimized libraries for mobile computer vision. Her research has been focused on human-computer interaction in cars and has led to the development of NVIDIA’s innovative DriveIX product for smart AI-based automotive interfaces for future generations of cars.</p><p>Shalini received her Masters and PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. She received a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from Punjab Engineering College.</p><p>In this episode, we talk about her journey - about how she got started with Computer Vision and Machine Learning, from her Bahelor's to her Master's in BiomedicaliImaging to her PhD work on Human Face Recognition - about how her research interests shaped over the years. We also talk about Machine Learning inside the car, about her vision of using Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning for building smart assistive interfaces for inside the car, and about how that manifested into the DriveIX product that NVIDIA recently launched. Among other things, we talk about the importance of open-sourcing technology, about the future of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, about the joys of learning something new everyday, about how to keep track of the every growing amount of research and much more.</p><p>It was an absolute pleasure to talk with Shalini and learn from her research insights. I hope you like the conversation.</p><p>Links: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hfz965mLuvM">Youtube</a> / <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ya98vk7b">Anchor.fm</a> / <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9hu7lzq">Apple Podcasts</a> / <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yb6sn2rv">Spotify</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DNN 8: Computer Vision & ML Research, Super SloMo // Varun Jampani]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" title="Spotify Embed: DNN 8: Computer Vision and Machine Learning Research, Super SloMo | Varun Jampani" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2V4omMjSSGADPqmWgQ89DK"></iframe></figure><p>In this episode, I interview Varun Jampani, who is a Research Scientist at Google Research.

You might recognise him from the renowned Super SloMo paper. His work lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. His main focus is to leverage machine learning techniques for better inference in computer vision models.</p><p>Prior to joining Google, he was a research scientist at NVIDIA.He completed his PhD at the Max-Planck Institute (MPI) for Intelligent Systems. He is also a IIIT Hyderabad alum, where he did his Bachelor's and Master's.</p><p>In this episode we talk about his journey — from his Bachelor's and Masters at IIIT Hyderabad to his PhD at MPI, about how his research has shaped over the years, about his focus on always asking good research questions and tackling fundamental problems in Computer Vision as a whole. We also talk about the SuperSloMo paper, about how it started, the key design decisions that were taken and the challenges faced in the process. If there's one thing that you are likely to take away from this conversation, it is the importance of asking good research questions and letting that drive your learning and research.</p><p>Links: <a href="https://youtu.be/05fGL5jEH5I">Youtube</a> / <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ycudgfse">Anchor.fm</a> / <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y8w7tkhf">Apple Podcasts</a> / <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7u98d7m">Spotify</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DNN 1: HDR Imaging & DL for Computer Vision // Shanmuga Raman]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" title="Spotify Embed: DNN 1: Deep Learning for Computer Vision, Computational Photography &amp; HDR imaging | Shanmuganathan Raman" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6d2EFs6Lke0gW4UMJj5jpO"></iframe></figure><p>In the first episode of the Deep Neural Notebooks podcast, I talk with Dr. Shanmuganathan Raman, who is an Associate Professor of Electrical &amp; Computer Science Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar.
