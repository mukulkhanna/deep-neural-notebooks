I've got the authors of the Practical Natural Language Processing book. The book is a comprehensive guide to building, iterating and scaling real world NLP Systems. It is for anyone who is involved in any way in building NLP systems in industry - from software engineers to data scientists to ML engineers to product managers and business leaders. The book is already topping the charts on Amazon and has been endorsed by various experts from academia and industry.</p><h3 id="episode-overview-">Episode Overview:</h3><p>So for this episode, I talk to the authors of the book - Sowmya, Bodhi, Anuj and Harshit.</p><p>We talk about the key ideas behind the book - about how it bridges the gap between theory and building practical ML/NLP solutions. We discuss the inspiration behind writing the book, how it stands out, how it has been structured, who can benefit from it and lots more. We also talk about the elephant in the room, GPT-3 and try to make sense of the hype around it and understand it's broader impact and how it positions us, as a community to leverage these systems on a wider scale.</p><p>We also talk about the state of ML and NLP in general, about the many misconceptions and misinformed expectations that surround these fields in the context of the business of AI, and about how they've tried to incorporate this message in the book.</p><h3 id="practical-natural-language-processing-book-">Practical Natural Language Processing Book:</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/09/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="DNN 10: Practical Natural Language Processing Book | NLP, ML & AI in the Industry | GPT-3 and more" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/09/image.png 1084w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Website: <a href="http://www.practicalnlp.ai/">http://www.practicalnlp.ai/</a><br>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/PracticalNLProc">https://twitter.com/PracticalNLProc</a></p><h3 id="authors-guests-">Authors / Guests:</h3><p>Sowmya Vajjala: <a href="https://twitter.com/adyantalamadhya">https://twitter.com/adyantalamadhya</a> <br>She is a research officer at National Research Council, Canadaâ€™s largest federal research and development organization.

His interesting background includes a PhD in Quantum Physics and a degree in Law, followed by a five-year long career as a Patent Attorney, before his passion for Science brought him to HuggingFace. Thomas, and his team at HuggingFace believes in the power of Open Source and have been active contributors on Github, sharing their research and progress, allowing the development of technology for the better.</p><p>In this episode, we talk about his diverse career background- his journey from Physics to Law to Deep Learning and Conversational Agents. We also talk about the vision at HuggingFace, the challenges in building a long-term, companion-like Conversational Agent, the state of Natural Language Processing, and how we can do better.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Links: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dowwasPBU5c">Youtube</a> / <a href="https://anchor.fm/deep-neural-notebooks/episodes/DNN-2-From-Quantum-Physics-to-Chatbots--HuggingFace--Conversational-AI--Deep-Learning-and-NLP--Interview-with-Thomas-Wolf-e99sit">Anchor.fm</a> / <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/deep-neural-notebooks/id1488705711?i=1000458435571">Apple Podcasts</a> / <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EUSdtVvv17DaMI5iSw3jp">Spotify</a></p>
