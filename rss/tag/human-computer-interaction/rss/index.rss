Her research interests are in computer vision and machine learning for human-computer interaction and smart interfaces.</p><p>At NVIDIA, she has developed technologies for gaze estimation, 2D and 3D head pose estimation, hand gesture recognition, face detection, video stabilization and GPU-optimized libraries for mobile computer vision. Her research has been focused on human-computer interaction in cars and has led to the development of NVIDIAâ€™s innovative DriveIX product for smart AI-based automotive interfaces for future generations of cars.</p><p>Shalini received her Masters and PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2004 and 2008. She received a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from Punjab Engineering College.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
