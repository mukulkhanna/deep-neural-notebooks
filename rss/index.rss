I ask him about his thoughts on religion, consciousness, meditation, his passion for music and much more. He also talks about how India never really recovered from colonialisation and how the quest for adoption of Western ideologies has left us devoid of any appreciation for our cultural heritage, and how unconditioning ourselves is the first step in moving forward on our spiritual path.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JK2X_ZM4vHM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Links: <a href="https://youtu.be/JK2X_ZM4vHM">Youtube</a> / <a href="https://anchor.fm/deep-neural-notebooks/episodes/DNN-6-Spirituality--Music--The-Bhagavad-Gita--Srinivas-Reddy-ecnl7p">Anchor.fm</a> / <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/deep-neural-notebooks/id1488705711?i=1000471317496">Apple Podcasts</a> / <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SJ7z5gavxGR9zaPFJkwCs">Spotify</a></p>

The proposed architecture has narrow layers, which provide state-of-the-art results for as low as 12 channel feature maps. Fewer and narrower layers means that the model has <strong>fewer parameters</strong> to learn, making them easier to train. The authors also talk about the importance of variation in input of layers as a result of concatenated feature maps, which prevents the model from over-fitting the training data.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*04TJTANujOsauo3foe0zbw.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="DenseNet -Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (CVPR 2017) 📑"></figure><p>Many variants of the DenseNet model have been presented in the paper.

This means that the number of features received by a dense layer ( <em>l </em>) from it’s preceding dense layer ( <em>l-1</em> ) is 32.

It was an awesome learning experience!</p><h3 id="open-source-robotics-foundation">Open Source Robotics Foundation</h3><p>Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF), or Open Robotics is an independent non-profit organisation that works on open software and hardware for use in robotics. Their two open-source software projects — <a href="http://ros.org/" rel="noopener">ROS</a> and <a href="http://gazebosim.org" rel="noopener">Gazebo</a> are the most commonly adopted frameworks for developing robots and their simulations. ROS and Gazebo have done wonders for the robotics community, driving academic research and product development in robotics all over the world. Open Robotics offers consultance, R&amp;D help, open source software services and custom engineering for robotics to industry and government.</p><h3 id="my-project">My project</h3><p>My GSoC proposal was for the <strong>Gazebo Documentation Index </strong>project. It was mentored by the best, <a href="https://twitter.com/_jrivero_?lang=en" rel="noopener">Jose Luis Rivero</a>, who is a Software Engineer at OSRF. My proposal can be accessed <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/serve/6486525154426880/" rel="noopener">here</a>.

Some noteworthy help can also be found through examples and explanations in the comments of Bitbucket issues (Gazebo’s repo) and Gazebo’s API. There are also third-party sources that provide video tutorials and blog posts that are helpful in learning Gazebo.

Creating a minimal stub of the doc index website was one of these tasks. My mentor had prepared a basic design for a couple of webpages that I was supposed to emulate.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RvTYuC_JMAZ1hfxdRXQNiQ.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Summer of Code 2019 is a wrap! ☀️"><figcaption>Minimal stub</figcaption></figure><h3 id="choosing-the-stack">Choosing the stack</h3><p>It was during developing these pages that I started thinking about how I could implement the documentation index in a way that it is easy to build, easy to maintain (adding, removing and updating index entries by open-source collaboration), light-weight and fast.</p><p>My preferred tool-kit for building websites was a Vuejs frontend + a Python (Flask) or Nodejs (Expressjs) backend + Heroku for serving a PostgresQL DB and for deployment.</p><p>But this had to be approached differently.</p><p>For example, the doc index would have had been difficult to maintain if the index entries were going to be stored in a conventional database, requiring a lot of pipeline setup, sync issues and making it difficult for any Gazebo developer who wishes to contribute because of requirement of pre-requisite knowledge of the stack.</p><p>Also, I realised that the website would only require two (or three) major template pages, so going for a comprehensive front-end framework would have been overkill.</p><p>I was looking for a more integrated approach (Oh, Steve Jobs would have been so happy to hear that), that would be easier to maintain.</p><p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a> had everything I was looking for. With it’s Static Site Rendering (SSR), templating engines and easy data management using YAML-based frontmatter in Markdown files, Jekyll was the perfect choicde.</p><p>The best thing about Jekyll was how the data of the doc index could reside in these adorable Markdown files that were easy to maintain and collaborate on using Github PRs. This helped in eliminating the requirement of a backend server and a database. Because of Github Pages support for Jekyll, hosting also wasn’t an issue anymore.</p><p>I developed the prototype using Jekyll and after the project started, I discussed the advantages of using Jekyll with my mentor, who agreed that this was the way to go. Some important index entries, that my mentor had listed, were added to the website.</p><h3 id="structuring-the-doc-index">Structuring the doc index</h3><p>The next step was to decide how to structure the doc index in a way that it was easy to scale and again, easy to maintain. We came up with a structure that is two levels deep, classified into categories and subcategories. The first level of abstraction is the category level and the second level is the subcategory level.</p><p><code>Category &gt;&gt; Subcategory &gt;&gt; Index entries</code></p><ul><li>Each category comprises of subcategories and each subcategory comprises of the corresponding index items.</li><li>Each category and index item also contain a brief description of the same.</li><li>More important index items can be shown starred.</li></ul><p>This hierarchical classification, as shown below has complied well with the requirements of the project.</p><pre><code>- category 1    - subcategory 1        - item 1         - item 2</code></pre><pre><code>- subcategory 2        - item 1         - item 2</code></pre><pre><code>- category 2 - category 3</code></pre><h4 id="all-links-page">All links page</h4><p>To allow for the user to be able to find all relevant content on one webpage, an ‘All links’ page was also added. This can help users in finding any help using a browser quicksearch (Ctrl + F).</p><h3 id="testing">Testing</h3><p>Test cases had to be written to automate the procedure of verifying that everything worked fine after any update to the code (commits and PRs). The two primary things to test here are —</p><ul><li>Integrity of index data structure</li><li>Validity of external links in index items</li></ul><p>For the first part, I wrote a spec <a href="https://github.com/osrf/gazebo-doc-index/blob/5cd394bffd5ba35a61cf72512decc4cb0c5b1390/spec/index_integrity_spec.rb" rel="noopener">file</a> in Ruby that parses all the data files and expects the structure of the index data to be maintained. For testing validity of external links, we used the very common <a href="https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer" rel="noopener">html-proofer</a> library that takes care of that.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*y78zn4NyN0E3KMpV.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Summer of Code 2019 is a wrap! ☀️"><figcaption>Index integrity test</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*K1xbY4qY4KKhLkth.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Summer of Code 2019 is a wrap! ☀️"><figcaption>HTMLproofer external link validity&nbsp;test</figcaption></figure><p>These test cases have been automated using Travis CI, that runs these tests for us every time there is a commit or a pull-request in the repo.</p><h3 id="user-interface">User interface</h3><p>For the user interface of the website, I made improvements to the minmal stub created by my mentor, trying to make it clean and minimal so that the prime focus was on the doc index entries.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FZ3oCXILxTi7b4ZNI7MiFA.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Summer of Code 2019 is a wrap! ☀️"><figcaption>Home page</figcaption></figure><p>For ease of collaboration, a ‘Suggest edits’ button was added that directly takes you to the Github editor using which any changes can be made to the index, and a PR can be opened.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CO5Oe59bZf6OlfZOMcnsCw.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Summer of Code 2019 is a wrap! ☀️"><figcaption>Category page</figcaption></figure><h3 id="alpha-launch">Alpha launch</h3><p>With this, we were able to launch the <strong>alpha version </strong>of the Gazebo Documentation Index, inviting developers and users to contribute to the growth of the platform.

There is a lot of information in the issues and their comments that is not otherwise documented. These issues can also be a reminder of relevant topics that people are facing difficulties with.</p><p>The suggestions-tool can be accessed <a href="https://gazebo-index.herokuapp.com/" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Mo3Utkhwrx2QuHW53wAS_g.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Summer of Code 2019 is a wrap! ☀️"><figcaption>suggestions-tool</figcaption></figure><p>The suggestions-tool scrapes content from Bitbucket issues, performs NLP based keyword extraction and provides a list of keywords pertaining to each issue.

If yes, then these can be marked in the suggestions-tool to keep a track of the issues that have already been covered in the doc index.</p><p>After a careful evaluation of the requirements, the app was developed using Vuejs + Flask + PostgresQL (hosted on Heroku) + Heroku.</p><h3 id="future-work">Future work</h3><p>I had a great time working on this project. I will continue to work on this project at least until it gains popularity and reaches the self-sufficient state. The next step is to get more information about this out to the users, and to get people to refer to this in answers to questions on the community page or the Bitbucket issues page.</p><p>These are the very beginning days of the Documentation Index and it has serious potential to become an important documentation resource that brings together all the relevant learning material in one place,in an organised fashion, helping beginners and professionals save time and resources and find the right help immediately.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[HDR Imaging: What is an HDR image anyway? 📷]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*E1pzpUrIPoMfaWNg.jpg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>We all have noticed how capturing images with the sun (or any bright objects) in the background usually doesn’t turn out well.

The image comes out to be either too dark or too bright depending on the focus. Let’s try to understand why this happens and how this can be solved.</p><p>There are a lot of key concepts that revolve around the study of HDR images -</p><ul><li><strong>Dynamic range</strong></li><li><strong>Image exposure</strong></li><li><strong>Shutter speed, Aperture, ISO</strong></li><li><strong>Image bracketing</strong></li><li><strong>Merging LDR images</strong></li><li><strong>Image encoding</strong></li><li><strong>Camera response function</strong></li><li><strong>Linearisation</strong></li><li><strong>Gamma correction</strong></li><li><strong>Tonemapping</strong></li><li><strong>Visualising HDR images</strong></li></ul><h3 id="dynamic-range">Dynamic Range</h3><p>Dynamic range of a scene refers to the range of light intensity that encompasses a scene. It can also be defined as the ratio of light (maximum measurable brightness) to dark (minimum measurable brightness) in an image.</p><p>To get some context of the how brightness can be quantised, the range of light intensity is 0 to infinity, with zero being the darkest and infinity being the brightest source there is (☀️) .</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YX1gBta3mldqWhvBMUmqsA.png" class="kg-image" alt="HDR Imaging: What is an HDR image anyway? 📷"><figcaption>Luminance value comparison (<a href="https://www.hdrsoft.com/resources/dri.html" rel="noopener">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>No camera is able to capture this complete uncapped range of illuminance in a scene. Therefore, images turn out to be either too bright (overexposed) or too dark (underexposed). These images are called <em>Low Dynamic Range</em> (LDR) images . For images that turn out too bright, it is only the brighter subrange (of the infinite range) that the camera is able to capture, and correspondingly for the darker images, only the lower subrange is captured.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CzMITGf7VZ6ly2wLKz_d1g.png" class="kg-image" alt="HDR Imaging: What is an HDR image anyway? 📷"><figcaption><strong>True image</strong> (Left), <strong>Overexposed image</strong> (Center), <strong>Underexposed image</strong> (Right)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="image-exposure">Image Exposure</h3><p>The amount of light entering the camera (and thus, the image) is called the exposure. The exposure of the image can be controlled by three settings of a camera — the aperture, shutter speed and ISO.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mQ_fmmAzRkmKX63SrfCV8A.png" class="kg-image" alt="HDR Imaging: What is an HDR image anyway? 📷"></figure><p><strong>Aperture:</strong> The area of the camera lens through which the light can come in.</p><p><strong>Shutter speed:</strong> The speed with which the shutter of the camera closes. As the shutter speed increases, the amount of light entering the camera decreases, and vice versa. It also improves the sharpness of an image.</p><p><strong>ISO: </strong>Sensitivity of the camera sensor to incoming light.</p><p>I found this nice analogy <a href="https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-exposure.htm" rel="noopener">here</a>, between the camera settings and a bucket left out in the rain.</p><blockquote>In photography, the exposure settings of aperture, shutter speed and ISO speed are analogous to the width, time and quantity in the discussion above. Furthermore, just as the rate of rainfall was beyond your control above, so too is natural light for a photographer.</blockquote><p>Back to <em>dynamic range</em>. A single image captured from the camera can not contain the wide range of light intensity.</p><p>This problem can be solved by merging images captured at multiple exposure values. How this helps is that the overexposed images work well for the darker regions in the image, and the underexposed images are able to tone down the intensity in the extra-bright regions. Different regions of the image are captured better at different exposure values. Therefore, the idea is to merge these set of images and to recover an image with a <em>high dynamic range</em> (HDR).</p><h3 id="image-bracketing">Image bracketing</h3><p>Bracketing refers to capturing multiple images of the same scene with different camera settings. It is usually done automatically by the camera. What happens when you use the HDR feature on your smart phone is that the phone captures 3 (usually) images at three different exposure times (or exposure values) in quick succession. The lower the exposure time, the lesser the amount of light that gets in. These three images are merged by the camera software and are saved as a single image, in a way that the best portions of each image make it to the final image.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gkqV3yHAhfQXEYGY.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="HDR Imaging: What is an HDR image anyway? 📷"><figcaption>A collage of 5 bracketed images that I found on the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR0PPA4JHjAhVQb30KHdH6DaUQjhx6BAgBEAM&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.highdynamicranger.com%2Fhow-to-use-auto-exposure-bracketing-for-hdr%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw0b8jjGtlbQ010BQW1YHPIQ&amp;ust=1562002928887447" rel="noopener">internet</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The funny thing here is that the image that is saved on your phone after the merging happens, is still not (technically) an HDR image. This is where the image encodings come into the picture (and also tonemapping — which we’ll discuss later).</p><h3 id="image-encoding">Image encoding</h3><p>Commonly, the images that we see on our phones and computers, are 8-bit (per channel) encoded RGB images. Each pixel’s value is stored using 24-bit representations, 8-bit for each channel (R, G, B). Each channel of a pixel has a range of 0–255 intensity values.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KyT2vpk6-OCt_Nu9SXCNyw.png" class="kg-image" alt="HDR Imaging: What is an HDR image anyway? 📷"><figcaption>Example of 24-bit (3x8-bit) encoding for an RGB pixel</figcaption></figure><p>The problem with this encoding that it is not capable of containing the large dynamic range of natural scenes. It only allows a range of 0–255 (only integers) for accommodating the intensity range, which is not sufficient.</p><p>To solve this problem, HDR images are encoded using 32-bit floating point numbers, for each channel. This allows us to capture the wide uncapped range of HDR images. There are various formats for writing HDR images, the most common being .hdr and .exr. All HDR images are 32-bit encodings but not all 32-bit images can be HDR images.</p><h3 id="camera-response-function-crf-">Camera Response Function (CRF)</h3><p>CRF is a function that shows the relationship between the actual scene irradiance and the digital brightness values in the image. It is also called as the Opto-electrical transfer function. Camera companies don’t provide their CRFs and consider it as proprietary information.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XA43PkIl_VE44Asilb5z2w.png" class="kg-image" alt="HDR Imaging: What is an HDR image anyway? 📷"><figcaption>Camera response function example</figcaption></figure><p>In an ideal world, the CRF should have a linear graph — meaning, the brightness value of the pixels in the image should be directly proportional to the actual irradiance in the scene. This is true for HDR images, but not for the usual images where the brightness values are altered to be able to contain them in a finite range. The more important reason for conventional images being de-linearised depends on how display devices work.</p><p>Back in the time of CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) displays, electrons were fired on a phosphor surface. The phosphor screen is known to emit photons upon being hit by accelerated electrons. However the brightness of the display didn’t vary linearly with the strength of the electron beam. This problem has been solved by modifying the incoming image/video source signals non-linearly in the direction opposite to the display’s non-linearity. By doing this, we can get a fair linear estimate of the natural scene brightness.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UW_uGegQxkl17PlHU0f2WA.png" class="kg-image" alt="HDR Imaging: What is an HDR image anyway? 📷"></figure><p>This de-linearisation of the source allows to compensate for a non-linear display. Display technologies have advanced but the non-linearity still exists in most devices. This <em>de-linearisation</em> is known as gamma correction.</p><blockquote>Gamma corrected image = image ^ γ</blockquote><p>If the input image is x, then what a display device of gamma=1.2 shows is x^(1.2). Therefore, the input image is encoded as x^(1/1.2) so that the monitor converts it to x^((1/1.2) x 1.2) which is equal to x, the original image captured by the camera.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4k6-goBZ-RVLWjd9psEXAA.png" class="kg-image" alt="HDR Imaging: What is an HDR image anyway? 📷"></figure><p>For most displays these days, images have to be encoded by a gamma value of 0.45 (1/2.2) because of a gamma decoding of 2.2 by the displays.</p><p>Gamma encoding is performed over a range of [0,1].

Now let’s look at how HDR images can be displayed.</p><h3 id="tonemapping">Tonemapping</h3><p>Most off the shelf display devices are incapable of delivering the wide uncapped range of HDR images. They expect the input source to be in the three-channel 24-bit (3x8) RGB format. Due to this reason, the wide dynamic range needs to be toned down to be able to accommodate it in the 0–255 range of RGB format. This can be done in several ways, some of which are-</p><ul><li>Conventional linear normalisation: This is the most basic way of bringing down the wide range of an HDR image.</li></ul><blockquote>tonemapped image = (img — img.min()/img.max() — img.min()) x 255</blockquote><ul><li>Reinhard tonemapping: This is one of the most commonly used tonemapping algorithm that was shared in this <a href="http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~peyre/cours/x2005signal/hdr_photographic.pdf" rel="noopener">paper</a>.</li></ul><blockquote>tonemapped image = img/(1+img) x 255</blockquote><ul><li>Drago tonemapping: This tonemapper is a perception-based one that compresses the dynamic range using logarithmic functions “computed using different bases from the scene content”.

However, this approach is likely to create ghosting (blur) artifacts when there is movement between the frames. This has been solved by first aligning the neighbouring frame with the reference frame (middle frame) using something known as <em>optical flow</em>. That can be a topic for another blog post but for now we can think of it as a way to estimate the motion of objects (or pixels) that happens across frames by assigning a displacement vector to certain pixel positions.</p><p>There also has been work in generating HDR frames from singular LDR counterparts using Deep Learning. Neural networks are successfuly able to learn complex representations between the input and the output, and have thus performed quite well in learning the LDR to HDR mapping.
